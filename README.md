### Hi there, I'm Jenn 👋

I am a Full-Stack Engineer living in the Bay Area working primarily in Node.js, React, PostgreSQL/MySQL, and mongoDB. 

Before my engineering career, I was a bean counter at Ernst and Young London, eventually transitioning into product management for B2B enterprise start-ups.

I've most recently been working on:

HealthyBilly. A portal for seekers and employers to find each other and offer support around the hiring/seeking process.
AtelierSystems. A Multi-module, load-balanced backend micro-service system for consumer product questions and answers.
ProductOverview. Built customer product discovery experience within an e-commerce retail web application.
