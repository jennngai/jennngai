### Hi there, I'm Jenn üëã

I am a Full-Stack Engineer living in the Bay Area working primarily in Node.js, React, PostgreSQL/MySQL, and mongoDB. 

Before my engineering career, I was a bean counter at Ernst and Young London, eventually transitioning into product management for B2B enterprise start-ups.

I've most recently been working on:

[Healthy Billy](https://github.com/HealthyBilly/BillyHealthy). A portal for health centric users to connect with local farmers and find organic and local groceries.
Atelier Systems(https://github.com/Magnificent-Malasada/QuestionsAndAnswers). A Multi-module, load-balanced backend micro-service system for consumer product questions and answers.
[Product Overview] (https://github.com/KindredKoalas/frontendcapstone). Built customer product discovery experience within an e-commerce retail web application.

Let's get in touch! ‚òéÔ∏è
